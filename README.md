# Parallel-Computing-MPI-OMP-CUDA
Parallel implementation of Sequence Alignment
Sequence Alignment â€“ a way to estimate a similarity of two strings of letters - is an important field in
bioinformatics

it is 2 projects that do the same -
We Using C Programing Langauase , CUDA , MPI , OMP for this Project.
MPI - For parallel the work to more Processor
OMP - Using Threads to parallel the job of each Processor
CUDA - Using the Nvidia GPU "POWER" :)
